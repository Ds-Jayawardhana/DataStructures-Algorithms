For this week's tutorial, we will look at another implementation of Divide and Conquer: computing powers of matrices.

The idea is that if we have a matrix A and want to compute A^n = A*A*...*A, we can split this power:

If n is 1, the result is just A itself
If n is even (e.g. A^6) we can split this into two equal parts (A^3 in the example) and then square the result
If n is odd (e.g. A^7) we can split this into two equal parts and one extra A; so we square the former and then multiply by A.
Write a program that does the following:

Implement the brute force version of computing matrix powers (using e.g. two-dimensional arrays to represent matrices)
Implement the Divide and Conquer version described above
Compare the two versions on some matrices for different powers (you will also want an auxiliary function to print a matrix in order to check the results of your functions).
