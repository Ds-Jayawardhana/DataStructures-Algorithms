our task this week is to complete the following functions in the BinarySearchTree class given below

output() should print the values in the tree in ascending order (consider implementing a recursive helper function for this one);
insert(int value) should insert the given value into the tree, preserving the order;
remove(int value) should remove the given value from the tree (if it is contained), preserving the order.
The lecture slides contain descriptions of how these operations are supposed to work. For some of these, it is a good idea to use the existing auxiliary functions.

You can test your implementation using the main function, which generates an array of random values and subsequently inserts them into a tree and removes them again. It optionally also prints the array and the tree after insertion (controlled by the printResults variable).

Run some tests to see if your implementation is correct (setting numValues to a low-ish number and printResults to true). Once all three functions work as intended, run some timing tests (using bigger numbers of values, doubling between tests, with printResults = false)
